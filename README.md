This application was built to furth practice a full stack application. The goal is to create a web application that my brother can use to check enter in his weightlifting progress. The user can enter in data, which is stored in a PostgreSQL table; and then can be edited or deleted. It uses the following languages and framworks...

-JavaScript
-React.js
-Express.js
-PostgreSQL
-APIs
-HTML

Going foward I will be posting this to a live web application, and adding an option for other users. Eventually I would like the user to be able to log in and have their information already saved so that is something I would like to improve on. I would also like to make the front end a more visually appealing, since right now the goal was just function.
