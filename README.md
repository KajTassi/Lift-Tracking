# This application was built to further practice a full stack application. The goal is to create a web application that my brother can use to check enter in his weightlifting progress. The user can enter in data, which is stored in a PostgreSQL table; and then can be edited or deleted. 

 It uses the following languages and framworks...

- JavaScript
- React.js
- Express.js
- PostgreSQL
- APIs
- HTML

# To get this to run on your local machine...
 Start by cloning and downloading the repository. Once you have done that, you will want to run npm i to install dependancies. Next, you will want to link in a postgreSQL data table by navigating to the server folder, and then to the db.js file. Once you have filled in the the information, you can run nodemon index to launch the backend of the project, and then run npm start from the client folder to start the front end. The project will be working when both of those are run and it will new information put in.

Going foward I will be posting this to a live web application, and adding an option for other users. Eventually I would like the user to be able to log in and have their information already saved so that is something I would like to improve on. I would also like to make the front end a more visually appealing, since right now the goal was just function.
